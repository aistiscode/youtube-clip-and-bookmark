# ClipStamp

**Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress

## Try It Out
You can use the app live here: [ClipStamp on GitHub Pages](https://aistiscode.github.io/youtube-clip-and-bookmark/)

## Overview
ClipStamp was created to address a missing feature in YouTube's UI, as it does not provide a native way to create bookmarkable clips that play only a specific portion of a video. This tool allows users to generate links that start and end at specified timestamps, making it possible to easily bookmark and precise moments in a video.

## Current Features
- Accepts a YouTube URL, start, and end timestamps as inputs, and generates a link that plays the selected clip.

## Planned Features
- [⚙️ In Progress] Process every possible kind of youtube URL
- [ ] Ability to easily clip and bookmark videos from a great number of other video providing websites (planned)
- [ ] Design overhaul (planned)
